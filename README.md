# tictactwist
A twist on your usual tic tac toe game.

This was a procrastination project. I had two midterms during the following
week and I didn't want to study, so I decided to code this up. Therefore, if
you're a recruiter and notice my cse20 or math20b grades aren't the A's you're
hoping for, blame coding for being so much more enjoyable.

The initial reason for this project was to understand how to have the browser
scroll to specific locations on the page, because I always thought that was a
pretty cool piece of functionality. I ended up turning it into tic tac toe
because I wanted to apply this new cool thing somehow.

There are some inefficiencies in the code that I plan on going through and
improving eventually, but for now I'm going to leave it as a way to show self
improvement when I put other things up on GitHub.
